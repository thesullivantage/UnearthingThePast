            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3"> The Roman Amphitheater in Paris was very much a surprise to come across outside of Rome, because one would not
                think that such a large structure would be intact as it has been for two thousand years. Built in the first
                century in what is now the Latin quarter of Paris, it had the capability to hold wild animals for gladiatorial
                combat and seat thousands. It was unearthed in the 19th century. </p>

            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Although Notre Dame is much younger than some of the Roman ruins in Paris, the catacombs beneath it contain vestiges
                of the ancient past. Inside, ruins of a Roman bath house as well as docks can be found. They were uncovered
                in 1970 while an underground parking deck was being constructed. I was researching catacombs and happened
                upon the site. </p>

            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Built by Louis XIV out of jealousy of one of his (former) cabinet member’s palace, Versailles is one of the key
                symbols of 18th century absolutism. Built within close enough proximity to Paris that he could keep tabs
                on the affairs of state but far enough away that he could hold the aristocracy hostage, it was a very decadent
                place. Obviously the Hall of Mirrors was impressive, but what I found to be more so was the royal chapel.

            <h2 class="header center-align">Roman Temple of Cordoba</h2>
            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">The only such structure in Cordoba, this temple was built around the first century, presumably dedicated to the
                Imperial cult, and rediscovered in the 1950s. Some colorful varieties of marbles were used in its construction,
                which were sourced from local quarries. The skill used in its building showed that the tenants of Roman Cordoba
                spared no expense on craftsmen who could help turn their settlement into something resembling their home
                city.

            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Through some interesting tour-guiding and a proposed arranged marriage, I was able to take in the beauty of this
                sprawling structure for a second time, albeit a little less than when I had a level-headed guide. A mosque
                turned cathedral, Charles V inadvertently allowed a large Christian structure to be erected in the middle
                of the Mezquita, ruining some of its aesthetic. Nevertheless, its brickwork remained fascinating.</p>

            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">The Alcázar of Cordoba has been the seat of power for Roman governors and Spanish Kings alike, but the one that
                we visited has only been around since the fourteenth century. It is home to a beautiful Roman mosaic that
                was locally excavated in the 1950s. I was struck by the Alcázar’s large reflecting pool as well as the orange
                trees (which differ from the bitter oranges found in Seville).</p>

            <h2 class="header center-align">Roman Bridge of Cordoba</h2>
            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">In the first century, the emperor Augustus granted Cordoba the status of Colonia Patricia, the highest status
                that a colony could attain at the time. With this and Roman settlers came the influx of money for public
                works such as the Roman Bridge of Cordoba. I was truly shocked that its foundations were still functional
                today, even though I am familiar with the fact that engineers still yearn for the ancient Romans’ concrete
                methodologies.

            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Another one of my favorite sites (although it was my second time seeing it), the Alhambra is a magnificent site
                with even more magnificent facades. Owing the prominence of what would become Granada to the Roman settlement
                there, the foundations of the Alhambra were actually built on top of Roman fortifications in the late 9th
                century. It was not fully built into its current version until the 14th century, when the king known as “Alhamar”
                renovated what was a mere fortress. My favorite part of this site was the room with the white ceiling that
                looked like a mix of a spider’s web and the eye of a hurricane (and the wood of course).</p>

            <h2 class="header center-align">Italica</h2>
            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">The birthplace of Trajan and Hadrian, the former city of Italica lies within the province of Seville. One of
                the earliest Roman settlements, settled in 286 BC, its prominence rose with the ascension of Hadrian and
                Trajan, and many grew wealthy from exports, such as olive oil and grain. The mosaics here were definitely
                the most incredible that I saw throughout the trip. Although we were unable to see the amphitheater here
                due to the filming of the final Game of Thrones season, I have seen it to be impressive via Season 7.</p>

            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">A province for the wealthy of Rome to get away to and enjoy the goods that came out of the sea, Pompeii set the
                bar high in terms of level of preservation for all other sites that we visited. Famously buried by the eruption
                of Mount Vesuvius, the human statues left behind are both jarring and stunning to witness. The mosaics found
                here rival and probably surpass those seen in Italica, but they are also of a finer detail in some cases.
