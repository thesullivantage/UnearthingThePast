            <h2 class="header center-align">Paestum</h2>
            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3"> Inhabited before the time of the Greeks, by the time the Romans settled there building many of their signature
                urban structures, it was a treasured relic of Greek history. Of note to the elite of the Grand Tour would
                have been the Temple of Athena, which was converted to a center of Christian worship, and The Temple of Hera,
                arguably the best-preserved Doric temple “alive” today. Both structures were erected by the Romans. Although
                Paestum’s physical legacy is not as rich as Rome’s, the significance of its three largest structures have
                stood the test of time.</p>

            <h2 class="header center-align">Castel Sant'Angelo</h2>
            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">One of the most significant structures in Rome, simply due to the fact that it was a functional structure during
                all of its life, is Castel Sant’Angelo. Originally built as Hadrian’s Mausoleum, by its namesake to use as
                he and his family’s final resting place, it was fortified for use by countless Popes against strife from
                both within and outside of Rome. Even at the time of the Grand Tour, Holy Fathers still barricaded themselves
                inside of its walls.</p>

            <h2 class="header center-align">The Pantheon</h2>
            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Perhaps the most famous of the multireligious structures in Rome, and perhaps elsewhere, few structures match
                the iconoclasm of the Pantheon. Commissioned during the reign of Augustus and completed under Hadrian, it
                was eventually converted from pagan temple into a site of Christian worship. Of other interest to Grand Tourists
                would have been its postmortem inhabitants, notably Rafael. To put it very elegantly, it is truly amazing
                to look through the hole (oculus) in its ceiling.</p>

            <h2 class="header center-align">The Forum</h2>
            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">The centerpiece of at least Roman civic life, nothing comes to mind more for contemporary and elite Victorian
                tourists alike than the forum and its surroundings. So many celebrated figures have been celebrated here
                in their lifetimes and so many culture-shaping events have taken place here that it is hard not to feel the
                world-shaping energy that emanates from the place itself. It is historically the center of Rome, meaning
                that Rome’s earliest artifacts and structures have been found there.</p>

            <h2 class="header center-align">Trajan's Column</h2>
            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">One of my favorite structures in Rome, due in part to the ornateness of its carvings but also to different statues
                that have ridden its peak is Trajan’s Column. Built to commemorate Trajan’s victories in battle, it is located
                in Trajan’s forum, as opposed to “the” Forum. In the context of the Grand Tour, because of its height, it
                was something that at least did not disappoint the travelers of several centuries ago, whereas other structures
                were often quarried or buried away. It seems nondescript in comparison to the Victor Emmanuel monument, so
                much so that I almost passed it, but I was excited to find it.</p>

            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Although it was not as restored as it is today, the Colosseum was undoubtedly a marvel, to some extent, of the
                Grand Tour. For all visitors to Rome, it is simply awe-inspiring, albeit in a horrifying way, to imagine
                men fighting each other and wild beasts to the death inside. This must have been particularly hard to imagine
                when it had more rural and overgrown environs, which was the case for century upon century. It was also quarried
                for hundreds of years for the lime in the marble. It took my breath away as I saw it stepping out of the
                Metro station simply because of how iconic it is. </p>

            <h2 class="header center-align">Piazza del Popolo</h2>
            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">The first site that many travelers saw when entering from the north, Piazza del Popolo lies just inside the northern
                edge of the Aurelian Walls. It is home to the second largest and oldest obelisk in Rome and is in close proximity
                to the late Emperor Nero. It struck me how alike to St. Peter’s square it is, though it was only made an
                oval in the 19th century. </p>

            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Although I spent much of my time here napping, the number of well preserved structures here baffled me. I could
                only imagine retreating here among the countless baths, fountains, and shaded walkways. This was what it
                was built for by the emperor Hadrian, with very good access to both aqueduct and natural sources of water,
                and connected to Rome by several main roads. By the time that the Grand Tour became the norm, most of the
                mobile valuables had been looted, although the travelling aristocrats managed to find marbles here to take
                home. </p>

            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Home to the noteworthy She Wolf bronze and the Dying Gaul, the Capitoline Museums is considered to be one of
                the first museums in the world. This openness of display with regard to items of Roman history was crucial
                to the Grand Tour, as not everyone had access to the private collections of the Italian Aristocracy. It was
                originally conceived by Michelangelo but not opened to the public until the 18th century.</p>

            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">One of my favorite sites of the entire trip was the Villa D’Este, a magnificent, terraced Renaissance garden
                located in Tivoli. Although at the time of the Grand Tour, most of the gardens and fountains had fallen into
                disrepair. In the nineteenth century, restoration began that would lead the functionality and beauty of the
                villa and its gardens to restoration. Of particular charm, I though, was the water organ that plays daily.</p>
